How to use the application
    -   Once the application is open you will see the name of the application, the search bar, and a few tabs
    -   Type whatever you want to search into the search bar and then press the button
    -   navigate to one of the tabs by clicking on them and you will find all the information you need
    -   You are also able to press the save button to save the item you wish to view later and then go to the save tab to find them all
    -   You will then be able to delete items in your saved tab as you wish

How to install the app
    -   Download the zip file from github.com/JadenDeanBotha/scuffed-itunes
    -   once it is installed and unziped, open the folder in your IDE
    -   once there open up your terminal and cd into backend and type npm i, so that all the dependencies can be downloaded
    -   Do the same for the front end
    -   once that is done, cd back into the backend and type npm run dev. This starts up the backend server
    -   Open another terminal window and cd into the frontend folder and type npm start
    -   The app will then launch in the browser and you will be able to use the application as intended

How to test
    -   cd into front end from your terminal and type npm test and the application will run a snapshot and unit test
